# First Chapter Title

First chapter text should go here.
Subsequent chapters' should go in their own files with no YAML frontmatter;
those files should begin with a top-level heading (`#`).
If you want each chapter to have its code chunks run in a fresh R session,
create a file called `_bookdown.yml` and add a line there `new_session: yes`.
By default, when you build the output of this project,
it will create the output in `_book/_main.pdf`;
you can override this default in `_bookdown.yml`
with `book_filename: my-book-name.md`.
More information about using bookdown can be found at https://bookdown.org/.
